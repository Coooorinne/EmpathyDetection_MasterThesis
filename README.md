About my thesis: 
Rapid advancements in today’s technology and globalization urge the need for empathic leadership. Yet, empathy experiences a major decrease amongst students and educational institutions are not prepared to teach empathy skills to students due to limited resources in large-scale lecture formats. However, recent advancements in Natural Language Processing offer new possibilities to detect empathy in textual data and foster empathy skills amongst students. In this master’s thesis, an Empathy Learning Application (ELEA) was built that provides students with adaptive and individual feedback on their empathy level. Empathy is the ability to react to the observed experiences of another and to simply understand the other person’s perspective and consist of both emotional and cognitive components. The responsive writing-support system was built in three design cycles, following the Design Science Research approach. First, a corpus to model empathy in student-written peer reviews was created, second, two artificial neural networks to predict empathy based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers were developed, and third, a responsive writing-support system to provide students with adaptive feedback in their individual empathy learning journey was designed. User experiments revealsignificant higher empathy skill learning with ELEA compared to an alternative tool. Additionally, ELEA’s high technology acceptance amongst students indicates promising results to incorporate the empathy learning application to further educational settings and foster empathy skills of students.
